        Outcome based education (OBE) is student-centered instruction model that focuses on measuring student performance through outcomes. Outcomes include knowledge, skills and attitudes. Its focus remains on evaluation of outcomes of the program by stating the knowledge, skill and behavior a graduate is expected to attain upon completion of a program and after 4 years of graduation. In the OBE model, the required knowledge and skill sets for a particular engineering degree is predetermined and the students are evaluated for all the required parameters (Outcomes) during the course of the program.

        Why institutions need to follow OBE?
        </font>
   </h3><p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace"><font size="4">
    The induction of India in the Washington Accord in 2014 with the permanent signatory status of The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is considered a big leap forward for the higher-eduction system in India. It means that an Engineering graduate from India can be employed in any one of the other countries who have signed the accord (Know more about the Washington accord here). For Indian Engineering Institutions to get accredited by NBA according to the pacts of the accord, it is compulsory that engineering institutions follow the Outcome Based Education (OBE) model. So, for an Engineering Institution to be accredited by NBA it should compulsorily follow the OBE model.
